# Kokalee: Fog Computing for Teams
Kokalee creates mobile intranets that can be used by a wide variety of stake holders working at the edge of the network and beyond.

This project utilizes several networking devices. Comes with a Slack-like chat client along with a file sharing service that is very similar to DropBox.
